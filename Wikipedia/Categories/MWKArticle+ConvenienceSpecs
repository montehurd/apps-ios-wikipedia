Feature: Best image

    Scenario: Load the "world heritage site" enwiki article

        Given I am in the article view with a lead image that is slighly pixelated
        When I tap on the lead image and it downloads a higher resolution version of the lead image
        And I close the image gallery
        Then the lead image should now be showing the high resolution image the gallery retrieved
        And if I tap the "back" arrow then tap the "forward" arrow
        Then the lead image should still show the high resolution image
